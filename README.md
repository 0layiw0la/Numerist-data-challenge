# <a name='ProblemStatement'></a>Problem statement

As a Data Analyst, your task is to analyse the provided data set to determine the success of the product launch for SocialBlaze's new app, Ribbon. SocialBlaze also have another app called InstantSnaps - Users accounts on InstantSnaps will be linked to Ribbon.
Your analysis will focus on key metrics and insights to present to the CEO and Founder.

# <a name='intro'></a>Introduction

This data set for this analysis was provided by SocialBlaze. The data contains key data on ribbon's operations from july 6th to august 5th a range of 32 days, This data will be used to access the applications possible success and how to leverage on the possible success or avoid failure.In this report i will be taking into consideration some key performance indicators (KPI) like the retention rate, engagement metrics , growth rate and the crash rate. 

# <a name="acquire"></a>User Acquisition Metrics.

## User Sign ups

Over 3.4 billion people have installed the ribbon app since launch, but about **3,385,000(three million three hundred eighty-five thousand.)** of these installations failed to complete the signup process. This could be caused by an overly complicated or confusing signup process causing users to get frustrated and abandon the app before completing the registration process.

## Retention rate

Retention rate is a crucial and valuable metric for assessing the success of a social media app. It indicates how well the app retains its active users over time, and these users play a significant role in driving engagement. By focusing on retention, app developers can ensure a loyal and engaged user base, which is vital for the app's long-term success and growth.

Fortunately Ribbon has a good retention rate, the social media app industry benchmark for a one month retention social media apps is between 25% to 40% retention rate and Ribbon has a 77% retention rate, which is above the benchmark.

## Growth rate
        
Another important thing to consider is Ribbon's growth rate. Considering that for early-stage or newly launched social media apps, a DAU growth rate of 10% to 20% per month (10 to 20 times its initial count) can be considered acceptable. Ribbon demonstrated an astonishing daily growth rate, increasing its number of daily users by an astounding 1874 times the original count. within a month.

# <a name="engage"></a>Engagement metrics

## session duration

Another key factors is how long these users are staying online, longer session durations show that the product is able to provide value for the users.

But how long the users are staying online on it's own doesn't tell us much we also need to look at if they are actively engaging  on the app to get a clearer picture on ribbon's possible success. 

## Post visibility

Post visibility helps analyze algorithim performance, optimise posting strategy, and maximize content reach. Higher visibility leads to increased user engagement and provides insights into user interests. During this one month period a toal of 62,288,000 (sixty-two million two hundred eighty-eight thousand) posts were made on ribbon but only 25,380,620 (twenty-five million three hundred eighty thousand six hundred twenty) were actually seen by users. meaning only 38.87% of posts on ribbon were actually seen by users. This falls within the acceptable range of 30% to 50% for social media apps.

Although it falls within the accepted benchmark more than half the posts made aren't actually seen by users. This could lead to lower user engagement and revenue generation. A poorly optimized algorithm could cause this as it may be suppressing content and only favours specific types of post. It could also be as a result of the app failing to provide personalized and relevant content for each user.

## Overall engagement rate

The overall engagement rate is a comprehensive metric that considers all types of user interactions (likes and reposts in this case) in relation to the total audience. Ribbon has an overall engagement rate of 0.89 (or 89%), meaning 89% of users are engaging with content on the app.

The chart below shows a steady growth in user engagement over the month. A steady growth of engagement over a month in a social media app indicates consistent and incremental improvements in user interaction and activity. This positive trend suggests that users are actively engaging with the content and finding value in the app's features. The app's content strategy is likely effective in delivering engaging and relevant content consistently.

# <a name="stable" ></a>App stability

We can measure how stable the app is using crash rate per user. The app has a crash rate per user of 0.06, which mean on average evry user experienced 0.06 (or 6% ) crashes while using the app which is more than the industry standard of 1%. This indicates that a significant number of users are experiencing frequent crashes while using the app. This leads to a poor user experience, decreased user engagement, negative reviews, and potential loss of revenue.

# <a name="conc"></a>Conclusions

After conducting a comprehensive analysis of the app's performance and market dynamics, I are pleased to report that my findings strongly indicate a promising outlook for Ribbon. The app's engagement metrics, including daily active users (DAU) and retention rates, have demonstrated positive trends with Ribbon having demonstrated a 89% overall engament rate **(89% of active users are engaging on the app)**, which reflects a growing user base and sustained user interest over time.

The app's growth rate throughout the month has been impressive, with a substantial increase in daily users observed from the beginning to the end of the month, resulting in a remarkable  growth in the number of users, **about 1874 times (187400% increase) the original count**.

Furthermore, the app's competitive analysis reveals that its unique value proposition and innovative features provide a competitive edge in the social media app market. With an effective user acquisition and retention strategy which reflects in its retention rate of 77% **(77% of total installations remain active on the app)**, I believe Ribbon is well-positioned to achieve continued success and sustainable growth in the dynamic social media landscape.

I am optimistic about the future of Ribbon and its ability to captivate and engage users, ultimately contributing to a successful venture in the social media industry.

# <a name="rec"></a>Recomendations for Improvement

* The signup process has to be optimized to make it quick, easy, and user-friendly this will help user retention. The team at ribbon should also collect user feedback on any confusing or complex parts of the signup process to aid optimization.
  
* The marketing team should strive to ensure users understand the app's value proposition from the start as this will help in user acquisition and retention.
  
* The ribbon app content suggestion algorithm needs to be optimized so users receive personalized and relevant content. This can help solve the issue of posts not being seen by users and increase user engagement. A feedback loop that allows users to provide explicit feedback on content suggestions should be integrated into the app. This feedback can be to further refine the algorithm and enhance personalization.

* During the analysis I noticed that the app has a crash rate which is higher than the industry benchmark, To address this issue the team is advised to prioritize app stability and performance. Implementing regular code reviews, and testing, along with the integration of crash analytics and monitoring tools are essential for continuous improvement and enhancing user experience.

* Since users instantsnaps and ribbon accounts are going to be connected the Socialblaze team should enable users to carry over followers between apps as this will allow for a seamless transition between apps, and give content creators the opportunity to start interacting and engaging with their audience immediately,  resulting in better content performance and higher engagement metrics.

  ## Answer's to the CEO'S questions
  
* Ribbon's success can be leverage to enhance other products and services through the following ways :
  
    * Cross promotion :  Ribbon's user base can be used to promote other products and services on the company through targeted advertisements on the app.
