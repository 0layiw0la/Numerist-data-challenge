# Intorduction

This data set for this analysis was provided by Socialblaze. The data contains key data on ribbon's operations from july 6th to august 5th a range of 32 days, This data will be used to access the applications possible success and how to leverage on the possible success or avoid failure.In this report i will be taking into consideration some key performance indicators (KPI) like the retention rate, engagement metrics , growth rate and the crash rate. 

## Retention rate
Retention rate is a crucial and valuable metric for assessing the success of a social media app. It indicates how well the app retains its active users over time, and these users play a significant role in driving engagement. By focusing on retention, app developers can ensure a loyal and engaged user base, which is vital for the app's long-term success and growth.

Fortunately Ribbon has a good retention rate, the social media app industry benchmark for a one month retention social media apps is between 25% to 40% retention rate and Ribbon has a 77% retention rate, which is above the benchmark.

## Growth rate
        
Another important thing to consider is Ribbon's growth rate. Considering that for early-stage or newly launched social media apps, a DAU growth rate of 10% to 20% per month (10 to 20 times its initial count) can be considered acceptable. Ribbon demonstrated an astonishing daily growth rate, increasing its number of daily users by an astounding 1874 times the original count. within a month.

## session duration

Another key factors is how long these users are staying online, longer session durations show that the product is able to provide value for the users.

## Engagement metrics

But how long the users are staying online on it's own doesnt tell us much we also need to look at if they are actively engaging  on the app to get a clearer picture on ribbon's possible success. 

## Post visibility

Post visibility helps analyze algorithim performance, optimise posting strategy, and maximize content reach. Higher visibility leads to increased user engagement and provides insights into user interests. During this one month period a toal of 62,288,000 (sixty-two million two hundred eighty-eight thousand) posts were made on ribbon but only 25,380,620 (twenty-five million three hundred eighty thousand six hundred twenty) were actually seen by users. meaning only 38.87% of postson ribbon were actually seen by users. This falls within the acceptable range of 30% to 50% for social media apps.

Although it falls within the accepted benchmark more than half the posts made aren't actually seen by users. This could lead to lower user engagement and revenue genration. A poorly optimised algorithim could cause this as it may be suppressing content and only favours specific types of post. It could also be as a result of the app failing to provide personalized and relevant content for each user.

## Overall engagement rate

The overall engagement rate is a comprehensive metric that considers all types of user interactions (likes and reposts in this case) in relation to the total audience. Ribbon has an overall engagement rate of 0.89 (or 89%), meaning most users are engaging with content on the app.

The chart below shows a steady growth in user engagement over the month. A steady growth of engagement over a month in a social media app indicates consistent and incremental improvements in user interaction and activity. This positive trend suggests that users are actively engaging with the content and finding value in the app's features. The app's content strategy is likely effective in delivering engaging and relevant content consistently.

## App stability

We can measure how stable the app is using crash rate per user. The app has a crash rate per user of 0.06, which mean on average evry user experienced 0.06 (or 6% ) crashes while using the app which is more than the industry standard of 1%. This indicates that a significant number of users are experiencing frequent crashes while using the app. This leads to a poor user experience, decreased user engagement, negative reviews, and potential loss of revenue.



the number of crashes ccorrrelates positively the number of users, meaning the more users there are the more frequent crashes get. The chart below shows us that most crashes occur when the amount of users crosses 72,000,000.
